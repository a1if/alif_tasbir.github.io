Tomato Leaf Disease Classification
Python,Tensorflow,Flask,Mlflow,Dvc
Developed an end-to-end machine learning system to classify various diseases affecting tomato plants using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Python, which helps enable efficient disease identification and informed
crop health decisions for farmers and researchers.
•

Football Analysis System
Python,OpenCV
Developed a football analysis system using computer vision and deep learning using the Roboflow dataset. It uses
YOLO to track players, officials, and the ball in football games. It goes beyond pre-trained models by training its
detector and assigning teams based on jersey colors. Analyzing camera movement and perspective, it tracks
players in meters and calculates their speed and distance.
